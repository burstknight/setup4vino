# setup4vino.sh

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Motive
  I develop some applications on the NVIDIA Jeston AGX Xavier 
devices. I have requirment that I use remote NVIDIA Jeston devices. 
In the NVIDIA device, the OS has a built-in program `vino` that is 
vnc server. In order to easily setup vnc server, I wrote scrip file.
